"""strip-docket-artifacts — delete every AI-assisted-development / rhizome file from
this checkout in one pass, for anyone reusing docket who wants none of it.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO. It edits your LOCAL WORKING COPY only: it does not
touch git history (the files remain in past commits — see AI-ASSISTED-DEVELOPMENT.md
if you want them gone from history too, which is a separate, more disruptive
operation), and it does not change what a `git clone` of this repo hands the next
person (see .gitattributes for what `git archive` / a GitHub "Download ZIP" /
release tarball already excludes on its own, with no script to run).

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT JUST A DOCS LIST. The list below is the authoritative manifest
of "files whose only job is serving rhizome/AI-assisted development, never the
product" — see AI-ASSISTED-DEVELOPMENT.md's table for what each one is and why it
exists at all. Keeping the manifest here, in one place, next to the code that acts
on it, is what keeps "the docs" and "the delete list" from drifting apart.

Run it, review the dry-run list, then re-run with --yes:

    python3 tools/strip-docket-artifacts.py           # dry run — lists what would go
    python3 tools/strip-docket-artifacts.py --yes      # actually deletes

After running, docket itself (docket-propose.py, docket.html, src/, test/,
examples/, tag-taxonomy.md, build.mjs, package.json) is untouched — nothing here
can delete product code, because the manifest below is an explicit allowlist of
exact paths, not a pattern match.
